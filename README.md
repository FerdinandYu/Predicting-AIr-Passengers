# Predicting Air Passengers
Predicting Air Passengers with XGBoost

This is the final project of **MAP536: Python for Data Science** taught at Ã‰cole Polytechnique. We were presented with the challenge to help an unnamed airline company to predict how many passengers will travel on a given date in order to best allocate the planes among possible routes. 

Available historical data included:
  * date
  * number of passengers
  * departure and arrival airports
  * how early the tickets were booked

We were permitted to use any relevant external data we could find. The goal was to build a model with the strongest predictive power.
